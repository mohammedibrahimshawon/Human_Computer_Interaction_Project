## üéØ Abstract
This project presents a gesture-controlled virtual mouse that utilizes a webcam to recognize human hand gestures and control mouse operations (movement and clicks) in real time. The system requires no external devices and relies on computer vision and machine learning techniques for gesture detection.

## üß† System Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/mohammedibrahimshawon/Human_Computer_Interaction_Project/raw/master/1hci.png)

- Captures real-time video feed using a built-in or external webcam.
- Detects and classifies hand gestures using **MediaPipe** and computer vision algorithms.
- Translates recognized gestures into mouse events:
  - Cursor movement
  - Left click
  - Right click
  - Double click

> Hand position and recognized gestures control mouse events. Colored markers or specific hand postures improve tracking accuracy.

## üìö Background and Motivation

Hand gestures provide a natural form of communication. Traditional input devices like mice and keyboards can be limiting in certain contexts. This system eliminates the need for physical contact, enabling applications in assistive technology, cleanrooms, medical environments, and smart interfaces.

Inspired by advances in machine learning and computer vision, this project leverages low-cost hardware to create intuitive interaction methods.

## üìä Evaluation

![Gesture Recognition Interface](https://github.com/mohammedibrahimshawon/Human_Computer_Interaction_Project/raw/master/hvi2.png)

- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition with high accuracy.  
- Supports both **bare hand gestures** and **color glove-based detection**.  
- Integrates voice commands to extend interaction capabilities.  
- Runs smoothly on Windows platforms with standard webcams.  
- Improved user experience under different lighting conditions.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Mouse cursor movement using hand position.  
- Left click, right click, and double click recognition via gestures.  
- Voice command support (optional).  
- No additional hardware required beyond a webcam.  
- Two modes for gesture detection:  
  - Bare hand (MediaPipe)  
  - Color glove detection for precision.

## üß™ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on Windows  
- Webcam connected or built-in

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammedibrahimshawon/Human_Computer_Interaction_Project.git
   cd Human_Computer_Interaction_Project

2. Install required Python packages:
